Small collection of projects i did / am doing with my Esp32/Esp8266/Raspberry Pi

1. When a folder has "micropython" in it, then it means that you need to flash the esp with a micropython .bin first. Using at least Version 1.21.X should suffice.
2. The contents of every other folder are to be used with ArduinoIDE AND the needed libraries (the latter will be quite challenging since i used older versions of current libraries... Good luck!).
