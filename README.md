Small collection of projects i did / am doing with my Esp32/Esp8266/Raspberry Pi

1. When a folder has "micropython" in it, then it means that you need to flash the esp with a
micropython .bin first. Using at least Version 1.21.X should suffice.
Or you can use the images i've put in the "micropy used" folder.


2. The contents of every other folder are to be used with ArduinoIDE AND the needed libraries.
I'll put the names and authors of the libraries i've used in a plain text file called "important notes"
in every folder that uses ArduinoIDE


3. I will NOT show/mention the Pin-Usage for the 3.5Inch RPI Display since it may differ for your usage
   and is a headache to be change manually within ArduinoIDE. Sorry.
