The .zip library needs to be added manually to the ArduinoIDE since newer versions will not work with the current code.

Other libraries you might need in order to get the script to work are:
- Adafruit BusIO by Adafruit
- Adafruit GFX Library by Adafruit
- Adafruit ILI9341 by AdaFruit (might be needed when using a 9XXX Display)
- DHT sensor library by Adafruit
- DHT sensor library for ESPx by beegee_tokyo
- TFT_eSPI by Bodmer (VERY IMPORTANT)
- NTPClient by Fabrice Weinberg (As above metioned: use the .zip file from this folder)
  AND DO NOT AUTO-UPDATE THIS LIBRARY!

As for the Boards in ArduinoIDE:
- esp32 by Espressif Systems (i use an ESP32-Dev Board and this one works fine)
