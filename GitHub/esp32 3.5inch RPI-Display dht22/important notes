The .zip library needs to be added manually to the ArduinoIDE since newer versions will not work with the current code.

Other libraries you might need in order to get the script to work are:
- Adafruit BusIO by Adafruit
- Adafruit GFX Library by Adafruit
- Adafruit ILI9341 by AdaFruit 
- DHT sensor library by Adafruit
- DHT sensor library for ESPx by beegee_tokyo
- TFT_eSPI by Bodmer (VERY IMPORTANT)

--------- DO NOT UPDATE/AUTO-UPDATE THIS LIBRARY!-------------
- NTPClient by Fabrice Weinberg (As above metioned: use the .zip file from this folder)
--------- DO NOT UPDATE/AUTO-UPDATE THIS LIBRARY!-------------


As for the Boards in ArduinoIDE:
- esp32 by Espressif Systems (i use an ESP32-Dev Board and this one works fine)

For the PinOUT and Conections:
You can somewhat follow this Tutorial but it depends on what kind of ESP you are using.
https://www.tech-sparks.com/using-esp32-with-arduino-ide-to-control-an-lcd-display/


In this particular case use the following values in "Setup11_RPi_touch_ILI9486.h":
#define TOUCH_CS 18
#define TFT_MISO 2
#define TFT_MOSI 12
#define TFT_SCLK 14
#define TFT_CS   5
#define TFT_DC   15
#define TFT_RST  13

For this case use "ESP32 Dev Module" as Board under the Tools-Section in the ArduinoIDE. This will also change depending on the hardware you use.
