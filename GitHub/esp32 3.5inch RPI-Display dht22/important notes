The .zip library needs to be added manually to the ArduinoIDE since newer versions will not work with the current code.

Other libraries you might need in order to get the script to work are:
- Adafruit BusIO by Adafruit
- Adafruit GFX Library by Adafruit
- Adafruit ILI9341 by AdaFruit 
- DHT sensor library by Adafruit
- DHT sensor library for ESPx by beegee_tokyo
- TFT_eSPI by Bodmer (VERY IMPORTANT)

--------- DO NOT AUTO-UPDATE THIS LIBRARY!-------------
- NTPClient by Fabrice Weinberg (As above metioned: use the .zip file from this folder)
--------- DO NOT AUTO-UPDATE THIS LIBRARY!-------------


As for the Boards in ArduinoIDE:
- esp32 by Espressif Systems (i use an ESP32-Dev Board and this one works fine)

For the PinOUT and Conections:
You can somewhat follow this Tutorial but it depends on what kind of ESP you are using.
